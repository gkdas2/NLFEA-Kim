### Work in progress

Python version of the NLFEA code in textbook **Introduction to Nonlinear FEA**  by  Nam-Ho Kim. This is a very good textbook. 
I aim to gradually transition to numba/jax with faster execution and AD support, more element types, and dynamic fea capabilities.
* Only hex elements are implemented.
* Add folder to pythonpath with 
**export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/dirWithPackage/:$PYTHONPATH**

* See examples/ for usage

## TO-DO
Add dynamic nlfea part
